        "1.  What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "      Interpreted languages run line-by-line at runtime (Python).\n",
        "      Compiled languages are converted to machine code before execution (C, C++).\n",
        "      Interpreted = slower but flexible; Compiled = faster but needs compilation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "      It handles runtime errors using try, except, else, finally.\n",
        "      It prevents program crashes and allows graceful error messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "      finally runs always, whether exception occurs or not.\n",
        "      Used for cleanup like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "      Logging records events, errors, and information during program execution.\n",
        "      Used for debugging and monitoring applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "      __del__ is a destructor called when an object is about to be deleted.\n",
        "      Used to release resources but not reliable for time-critical cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "      import module imports whole module → use module.function().\n",
        "      from module import func imports only specific parts → use func() directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "      Use multiple except blocks or tuple of exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "      try:\n",
        "          x = 1/0\n",

        "          print(\"Handled\")\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "      It automatically opens and closes the file.\n",
        "      Prevents resource leakage.\n",
        "\n",
        "      with open(\"a.txt\") as f:\n",
        "          print(f.read())\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  what is Difference between multithreading & multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "      Multithreading → multiple threads share same memory (good for I/O).\n",
        "      Multiprocessing → multiple processes with separate memory (good for CPU tasks).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the advantages of using looging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "      Helps debug errors, track program flow, and store runtime info.\n",
        "      Better than print() because it supports levels and file logging.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "      Python manages memory automatically using a private heap and garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "       Write risky code in try, handle error in except, optional else for no-error part, and finally for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why memory management is important?\n",
        "\n",
        "       It avoids memory leaks, improves performance, and ensures efficient resource usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "      try contains code that might cause an error.\n",
        "      except catches and handles specific exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "      reference counting + cyclic garbage collector to free unused objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "      else runs only if no exception occurs in try.\n",
        "      Useful for code that should run only when everything goes right.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  whta is Difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "      os.fork() works only on Unix; directly creates a child process.\n",
        "      multiprocessing works cross-platform and provides safer, high-level process handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     It frees memory and ensures data is properly written to disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  what is Difference between file.read() and file.readline()?\n",
        "\n",
        "        read() → reads entire file.\n",
        "        readline() → reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
        "      It helps write logs to console/files with different levels for debugging and monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "        Provides functions for file/directory operations (create, delete, rename).\n",
        "        Example: os.remove(\"file.txt\").\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "       Circular references, large objects, and fragmentation can cause inefficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.  How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "        Use raise keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "        raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "      Multithreading is useful for tasks that wait (I/O), like downloading files, so the program doesn't freeze.\n",
        "      It increases responsiveness and uses CPU time efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "      import threading\n",
